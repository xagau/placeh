placeh core
=============

Setup
---------------------
placeh core is the original placeh client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of placeh transactions (which is currently more than 100 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download placeh core, visit [placeh.io](https://github.com/xagau/placeh/blob/master/placeh-windows-setup-x86_64.exe).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run placeh on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/placeh-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/placehd` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run placeh-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag placeh-Core to your applications folder, and then run placeh-Core.
